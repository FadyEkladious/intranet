An intranet is a private network that is used within an organization. Imagine it as a smaller version of the Internet, but only accessible to people within that organization.

We used the intranet central database where the company information and data are stored, allows employees to share information  and data so, they can work together on many projects. The intranet serves as a go-to source for company policies, news, and resources, making it easier to find important information, only employees or authorized members can access the intranet, keeping sensitive information secure.

an intranet is a valuable tool for organizations, helping to connect employees, streamline communication, and enhance productivity.
